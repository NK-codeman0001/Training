#How to be good ROR developer

-> Learn to FOCUS FOR LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
-> Create High Priority tasks for feature required by User
->Planning of any feature before jumping into execution. 
This was a major undertaking and we had a strict deadline, yet before getting to code anything, we spent 1-2 days only on the planning. Writing everything on pen and paper, to breakdown the feature into sub tasks, designs.. so that we had a clear picture in mind from day 1 what the end result is going to look like. If your documentation, planning and scoping of any project is done right, writing code is the most easy task.

-> Implements test  for every features
