Integer Numbers

Ruby supports integer numbers. An integer number can range from -230 to 230-1 or -262 to 262-1. Integers within this range are objects of class Fixnum and integers outside this range are stored in objects of class Bignum.

You write integers using an optional leading sign, an optional base indicator (0 for octal, 0x for hex, or 0b for binary), followed by a string of digits in the appropriate base. Underscore characters are ignored in the digit string.

You can also get the integer value, corresponding to an ASCII character or escape the sequence by preceding it with a question mark.

Example
123                  # Fixnum decimal
1_234                # Fixnum decimal with underline
-500                 # Negative Fixnum
0377                 # octal
0xff                 # hexadecimal
0b1011               # binary
?a                   # character code for 'a'
?\n                  # code for a newline (0x0a)
12345678901234567890 # Bignum

Floating Numbers
Ruby supports floating numbers. They are also numbers but with decimals. Floating-point numbers are objects of class Float and can be any of the following âˆ’
Example
123.4                # floating point value
1.0e6                # scientific notation
4E20                 # dot not required
4e+20                # sign before exponential
