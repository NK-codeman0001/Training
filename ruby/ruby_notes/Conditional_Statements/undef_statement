Ruby undef Statement
This cancels the method definition. An undef cannot appear in the method body.
By using undef and alias, the interface of the class can be modified independently from the superclass, but notice it may be broke programs by the internal method call to self.
Syntax
undef method-name
Example
To undefine a method called bar do the following âˆ’
undef bar
